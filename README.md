# 💻 Apple Technology

✨ The Apple Technology website is make for learning modern web development and cibersecurity Articles. It has a beautiful and slice UI/UX design for better user experience.
For my this very good practice like refactoring, responsive design, global state management, dark/light mode toggle, localization, skalton loading, GSAP animation, Counter animation, form validation by Zod and React Hook Form and more.
In this project I have used React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for styling and Superbase for backend services.
